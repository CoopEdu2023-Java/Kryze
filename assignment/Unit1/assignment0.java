 * Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that was
 * designed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1991 .
 * The compilation of the Java applications results in the bytecode that can be
 * run on any platform using the Java Virtual Machine.
 * Because of this, Java is also known as a WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere)
 * language.
 * In modern times, Java is one of the most popular programming languages as it
 * can be used to design customized applications that are light and fast and
 * serve a variety of purposes.
 * According to the TIOBE Index for April 2022, Java is among the top three
 * programming languages.
